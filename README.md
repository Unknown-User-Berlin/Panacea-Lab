# Panacea-Lab

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

I would like to develop an app that solves challenges faced by people in or about to enter the world of work. It should be simple and clear “like an Apple store only digital”. It would be possible for users to upload their CV, the AI screens this CV and finds tailor-made jobs for the person, if a key qualification is missing, further training offers are searched for, found and suggested to the person. It would also be possible for a network of users and recruiters to be created and matched with the help of a high level of scoring or similar “similar to a dating app :)” It should be an all-in-one solution for job seekers and recruiters. In addition, a social network should be created in which users can freely express their interest in jobs, and recruiters or business managers can initiate the publication of a post or application. It could be decentralised, but then you would have to make sure that enough potential users become aware of the website. It should be the best network that has ever existed.


## Background

The aim is to create a state-of-the-art, simple solution for job seekers, people in need of further training and recruiters, solving the following challenges:

* Disappointment at work
* Failure to fulfill one's own vision, mission or passion
* Lack of time - it simply has to be for everyone
* Lack of personal development due to an unsuitable job
* Individual solution for everyone
  - Young parents, pensioners, part-time/full-time, students, graduates, drop-outs, mini-jobbers, freelancers
* It can help recruiters to ideally fill vacancies (match, high scoring...)
* It is designed to show job seekers which key qualifications or expertise they lack - and then suggests suitable (online, hybrid, remote, local) training opportunities
* Ideally, it should also help people who have been discriminated against or bullied in their previous job to find something better
* It should be better, more modern and simpler than all job boards/job platforms


## How is it used?

It should be an app but there should also be a website. It would be conceivable for users to log in using their LinkedIn account or via Google or Apple. Registration should be as simple as possible and users should decide for themselves which data they want to provide and which not. The heart of the app and the website should be an AI solution that generates and produces the perfect match value - transparently and comprehensibly! It should not work with tracking or cookies, it must be much more modern, social and civilised. AI-based CV screening is used to make suggestions and create a scoring system: For example: Creativity 7/10; Communication 9/10; Working with customers 4/10; Social interest 7/10; Scientific 8/10....and then a scoring or similar is determined, this is compared with vacancies and matches are generated. 
You could offer it for free or for a fee (e.g. recruiter is looking for a suitable candidate, if he wants to see the profile, he or she needs a premium account). The score should be made up of at least 25 parameters, which should enable excellent profiling. It is essential that people also state their private interests and hobbies in order to achieve an effective match.


## Data sources and AI methods

Ideally, the data is obtained from the CV, as this document contains a great deal of information. The AI should therefore be able to recognize and evaluate the text, separate personal data from job data and hobbies etc. and segment them. Further data could be generated via the log-in with Linked-In or similar. As far as the coding implementation, i.e. the heart of my idea, is concerned, there is still a question mark on my part (unfortunately :(). However, I am sure that it can be implemented and will be great. The AI ​​should also work in such a way that open vacancies are identified for the right job seeker

## Challenges

* Guarantee a perfect job experience

* Take responsibility for wrong placements

## What next?

Exponential growth through the best solution ever. The solution should be unrivaled. It should ideally spread by word of mouth, a simple, excellent, visually perfect solution for challenges that many people have. It should simply help anyone who can't live out their skills in their job. It will be popular with recruiters and spread rapidly.

## Acknowledgments

The idea is mine alone, but I would like to share it with others. I am dependent on you and your input for the development, it should be a solution from some for
